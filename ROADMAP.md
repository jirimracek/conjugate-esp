# Things to do

- 4/27/2020 (0.5.0) - have all models implemented, what's next?
  - take a few days off
  - add async interface
  - clean up and publish to npm
  - there are 12815 known verbs, probably half of them are obsolete.  
    - want to keep all of them to be able to match a verb or its form to old texts, however ...
  - things I'd like to have
    - build a trie to be able to search for any form of any verb
    - have a separate *use only known (per la RAE) verbs* interface option?
    - shrink the size
    - will keep adding options here
