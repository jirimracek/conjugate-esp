- Tue 27 Oct 2020 07:56:09 PM CET, version 1.2.2
  - (updated on Thu 05 Nov 2020 07:38:28 PM CET, version 2.1.1)
  - possible upcoming changes
    - 1999 &amp; 2010 orthography rules - this concerns monosyllable orthographical changes as per la RAE
      - pre 1999 ***rió*** is the accepted version
      - 1999 through 2010 both ***rió*** and ***rio*** are tolerated
      - past year 2010 it is no longer acceptable to write ***rió***, the new correct form is ***rio*** with **no accent**
      - will add a new info header entry and deliver pre-2010 orthography only if it's requested
      - ~~will add a new optional parameter to *conjugate() / conjugateSync()*~~ -that was a Bad Idea&trade;
      - add new optional parameter to **Conjugator::constructor(ortho: Orthography = '2010')** instead and set &amp; get methods
      - more info <https://www.rae.es/espanol-al-dia/palabras-como-guion-truhan-fie-liais-etc-se-escriben-sin-tilde>
      - affected verbs
        - chiar (vaciar)
        - ciar (vaciar)
        - criar (vaciar)
        - fiar (vaciar)
        - fluir (huir)
        - freír (reír)
        - fruir (huir)
        - gruir (huir)
        - guiar (vaciar)
        - huir (huir)
        - liar (vaciar)
        - luir (huir)

        - puar (actuar)
        - reír (reír)
        - ruar (actuar)
        - triar (vaciar)
      - info **header data** will change (new info header entry) this should go to a **major version update**

    - (done in 2.0.1) dropping imprimir from model list and splitting dual participios
      - verbs that allow dual participio currently clump both participios together (imprimido/impreso, freído/frito, proveído/provisto and their derivatives).  They really should be listed separately, should have their own array for each participio
      - affected verbs
        - imprimir, imprimido / impreso
        - reimprimir, reimprimido / reimpreso
        - sobreimprimir, sobreimprimido / sobreimpreso
        - freír, freído / frito  - freír also has an orthography modification coming, see above
        - refreír, refreído / refrito
        - sofreír, sofreído / sofrito
        - proveer, proveído / provisto
        - desproveer, desproveído / desprovisto
      - should add new **header data entry**?  Why? There isn't any reason for doing so, is there?
      - result data format will change, this should go into a **major version update**

    - (done in 2.0.0) model changes - choose models that also have a pronominal version whenever possible - see wishlist below
      - list of proposed **changes from -> to** and other models with no pronominal versions - no changes. Notes: no P == there are no pronominal verbs using this model
        - AR
          - **agorar -> engorar/se**
          - **aullar -> aunar/se**
          - cabrahigar - noP, self model
          - **cazar -> rozar/se**
          - desdar - no P, self model
          - desosar - no P, self model
          - **empezar -> tropezar/se**
          - **pensar -> acertar/se**
        - ER
          - caber - no P, self model
          - **leer -> creer/se**
          - placer - leave alone, dual conjugation, second conjugation only for itself
          - poder - no P, self model
          - **prever -> rever/se**
          - querer - no P, self model
          - raer - no P, self model, dual
          - responder - no P, self model, dual
          - **roer -> corroer/se**
          - ser - no P, self model
          - tañer - no P
          - yacer - no P, self model
        - IR
          - adquirir - no P
          - argüir - no P
          - balbucir - no P, self model
          - bendecir - np P, self model
          - **colegir -> corregir/se**
          - delinquir - no P, self model
          - discernir - no P, self model
          - imprimir - no P
          - oír - no P
          - **prohibir -> cohibir/se**
          - **surgir -> dirigir/se**
      - this should go into a **major version update**

  - investigating what would it take to insert *highlight markers* - something that can be used to highlight the irregular changes from what the verb would have looked like if it was regular. For example
    - if poner was a regular verb, the first person indicative presente would be '*pono*', which of course it is not, it is *pongo*.  If the conjugation is marked, let's say with a dot '.' character, we would get back 'po.n.go' - with a marker to indicate that the 'n' is the irregular deviation from regular conjugation that can be shown as "po**n**go" or whatever the consumer wants
    - colgar, subj. presente *cuelgue* would become 'c.ue.lg.u.e' (c**ue**lg**u**e) or should it be 'c.uelgu.e' (c**uelgu**e)?  Hmmmm
    - what to do with 'missing parts'?  Hacer, futuro isn't '*haceré*' but *haré*.  'h.ar.é' (h**ar**é) to mark the change so it can be visually noted?
    - the marker should be easily replaceable by a regex and would always come in pairs
    - will add new **header data entry**
    - ~~likely additional parameter to *conjugate() / conjugateSync()*, meaning a **minor version change** but the result format change seems to require a **major version update**~~ - Bad Idea&trade; again
    - add new optional parameter to **Conjugator::constructor (highlight: Highlight = false)**, add set &amp; get methods

- 6/7/2020, version 1.2.0
  - new wishlist
    - reorganize / choose different models.  Reasoning:
      - some models are utterly unknown verbs, it would be nice to use something useful instead
      - would be nice to have a pronominal version of each model.  It's not possible because some models are only models for themselves and the pronominal version just doesn't exist.  But we can try
      - would be nice to have a shortest possible version of each model to maximize screen space.  It would also be easier to read and understand
      - optimization - the definitions file could be made smaller by joining the multitude of N & P duplicates into one NP or some such.  Not going to worry about it now as it's under 340k anyway, not enough bang for the buck
  - things accomplished
    - async interface added some time ago
    - npm package published long time ago
    - as of v 1.2.0 we only have verbs known to be used as per la RAE
    - use pre 1.2.0 version for verbs unknown to la RAE

- 4/27/2020 (0.5.0) - have all models implemented, what's next?
  - take a few days off
  - add async interface
  - clean up and publish to npm
  - there are 12815 known verbs, probably half of them are obsolete.  
    - want to keep all of them to be able to match a verb or its form to old texts, however ...
  - things I'd like to have
    - build a trie to be able to search for any form of any verb
    - have a separate *use only known (per la RAE) verbs* interface option?
    - shrink the size
    - will keep adding options here
