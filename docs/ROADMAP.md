Fri 04 Dec 2020 01:06:29 AM CET, version 2.3.0
____

- Tue 01 Dec 2020 10:48:10 AM CET
  - 2.3.x work
    - (done) return a full list of verbs, include reflexives so getVerbList() returns both hablar and hablarse
    - (done) accept reflexives as a valid parameter to conjugate() - it gets rejected now
      - internal: we don't need to propagate the pronominalKey from conjugate() to factory to models. Zap.
      - ~~prune the definitions file.  It's 396k now, more than half of the package, it can be taken down to about 200k~~ (12/4/2020 - nope not working, tried.  It's doable but the runtime goes up 25%. Bad Idea&trade;)
      - reorganize testing

- Thu 12 Nov 2020 07:09:14 PM CET, version 2.2.1-experimental
  - (done in 2.2.1-experimental) every array, every conjugation has the pronominals, which is totally unnecessary, we know what the pronominals should be
    - (done) drop the pronominals, put just one list in the info object insted of repeating it 20x for each array, I think it's a Good Idea&trade;
  - internal
    - reorganize tests
    - reorganize types, exports, imports - they're kind of scattered all over the place

- Tue 10 Nov 2020 01:33:36 PM CET, 2.2.1
  - (done) I should probably obsolete / delete some old (and some broken) npm packages
  - We have
    - 2.2.0  Mon 09 Nov 2020 09:58:41 PM CET,  tag v2.2.0, **keep**, stable, first stable that includes 1999 & 2010 ortho
    - 2.1.1  Thu 05 Nov 2020 07:38:28 PM CET,  tag v2.1.1, **obsolete, broken**, changes concerning pre and past 2010 orthography rules
    - 1.2.1, Tue 27 Oct 2020 06:07:18 PM CET,  tag v1.2.1, **obsolete, broken**, dev packages upgrade, TypeScript 4.0 updates - Bad Idea&trade;
    - 1.2.0, Sun 07 Jun 2020 06:30:11 PM CEST, tag v1.2.0, **keep**, first &amp; last 1.2.x, includes only RAE known/used verbs
    - 1.1.2, Fri 05 Jun 2020 02:20:07 PM CEST, tag v1.1.2, **keep**, stable, final 1.1.x, last version that includes verbs deemed unused or unknown by the RAE
    - 1.1.1, Fri 29 May 2020 11:57:28 AM CEST, tag v1.1.1, **obsolete**, stable, not needed
    - 1.1.0, Tue 19 May 2020 10:36:45 AM CEST, tag v1.1.0, **obsolete**, stable, not needed
    - 1.0.2, Mon 04 May 2020 02:55:30 PM CEST, tag v1.0.2, **keep**, stable, final 1.0.x
    - 1.0.1, Fri 01 May 2020 09:55:42 PM CEST, tag v1.0.1, **obsolete**, stable, initial version, not needed
    - 1.0.0, Fri 01 May 2020 07:29:54 PM CEST   - initial version, **obsolete** not synched with repository
  - Should probably just leave 1.1.2, 1.2.0 and the upcoming 2.2.0 and nuke the rest

- Tue 27 Oct 2020 07:56:09 PM CET, version 1.2.2
  - (last updated on Thu 05 Nov 2020 08:16:11 PM CET, version 2.1.2)
  - (done in 2.2.0) possible upcoming changes
    - 1999 &amp; 2010 orthography rules - this concerns monosyllable orthographical changes as per la RAE
      - pre 1999 ***rió*** is the accepted version
      - 1999 through 2010 both ***rió*** and ***rio*** are tolerated
      - past year 2010 it is no longer acceptable to write ***rió***, the new correct form is ***rio*** with **no accent**
      - will add a new info header entry and deliver pre-2010 orthography only if it's requested
      - ~~will add a new optional parameter to *conjugate() / conjugateSync()*~~ -that was a Bad Idea&trade;
      - add new optional parameter to **Conjugator::constructor(ortho: Orthography = '2010')** instead and set &amp; get methods
      - more info <https://www.rae.es/espanol-al-dia/palabras-como-guion-truhan-fie-liais-etc-se-escriben-sin-tilde>
      - affected verbs
        - chiar (vaciar)
        - ciar (vaciar)
        - criar (vaciar)
        - fiar (vaciar)
        - fluir (huir)
        - freír (reír)
        - fruir (huir)
        - gruir (huir)
        - guiar (vaciar)
        - huir (huir)

        - puar (actuar)
        - reír (reír)
        - ruar (actuar)
        - triar (vaciar)
      - info **header data** will change (new info header entry) this should go to a **major version update**

    - (done in 2.0.1) dropping imprimir from model list and splitting dual participios
      - verbs that allow dual participio currently clump both participios together (imprimido/impreso, freído/frito, proveído/provisto and their derivatives).  They really should be listed separately, should have their own array for each participio
      - affected verbs
        - imprimir, imprimido / impreso
        - reimprimir, reimprimido / reimpreso
        - sobreimprimir, sobreimprimido / sobreimpreso
        - freír, freído / frito  - freír also has an orthography modification coming, see above
        - refreír, refreído / refrito
        - sofreír, sofreído / sofrito
        - proveer, proveído / provisto
        - desproveer, desproveído / desprovisto
      - should add new **header data entry**?  Why? There isn't any reason for doing so, is there?
      - result data format will change, this should go into a **major version update**

    - (done in 2.0.0) model changes - choose models that also have a pronominal version whenever possible - see wishlist below
      - list of proposed **changes from -> to** and other models with no pronominal versions - no changes. Notes: no P == there are no pronominal verbs using this model
        - AR
          - **agorar -> engorar/se**
          - **aullar -> aunar/se**
          - cabrahigar - noP, self model
          - **cazar -> rozar/se**
          - desdar - no P, self model
          - desosar - no P, self model
          - **empezar -> tropezar/se**
          - **pensar -> acertar/se**
        - ER
          - caber - no P, self model
          - **leer -> creer/se**
          - placer - leave alone, dual conjugation, second conjugation only for itself
          - poder - no P, self model
          - **prever -> rever/se**
          - querer - no P, self model
          - raer - no P, self model, dual
          - responder - no P, self model, dual
          - **roer -> corroer/se**
          - ser - no P, self model
          - tañer - no P
          - yacer - no P, self model
        - IR
          - adquirir - no P
          - argüir - no P
          - balbucir - no P, self model
          - bendecir - np P, self model
          - **colegir -> corregir/se**
          - delinquir - no P, self model
          - discernir - no P, self model
          - imprimir - no P
          - oír - no P
          - **prohibir -> cohibir/se**
          - **surgir -> dirigir/se**
      - this should go into a **major version update**

  - (done in 2.2.1-experimental) investigating what would it take to insert *highlight markers* - something that can be used to highlight the irregular changes from what the verb would have looked like if it was regular. For example
    - if poner was a regular verb, the first person indicative presente would be '*pono*', which of course it is not, it is *pongo*.  If the conjugation is marked, let's say with a dot '.' character, we would get back 'po.n.go' - with a marker to indicate that the 'n' is the irregular deviation from regular conjugation that can be shown as "po**n**go" or whatever the consumer wants
    - colgar, subj. presente *cuelgue* would become 'c.ue.lg.u.e' (c**ue**lg**u**e) or should it be 'c.uelgu.e' (c**uelgu**e)?  Hmmmm
    - what to do with 'missing parts'?  Hacer, futuro isn't '*haceré*' but *haré*.  'h.ar.é' (h**ar**é) to mark the change so it can be visually noted?
    - the marker should be easily replaceable by a regex and would always come in pairs
    - will add new **header data entry**
    - ~~likely additional parameter to *conjugate() / conjugateSync()*, meaning a **minor version change** but the result format change seems to require a **major version update**~~ - Bad Idea&trade; again
    - add new optional parameter to **Conjugator::constructor (highlight: Highlight = false)**, add set &amp; get methods

- 6/7/2020, version 1.2.0
  - new wishlist
    - reorganize / choose different models.  Reasoning:
      - some models are utterly unknown verbs, it would be nice to use something useful instead
      - would be nice to have a pronominal version of each model.  It's not possible because some models are only models for themselves and the pronominal version just doesn't exist.  But we can try
      - would be nice to have a shortest possible version of each model to maximize screen space.  It would also be easier to read and understand
      - optimization - the definitions file could be made smaller by joining the multitude of N & P duplicates into one NP or some such.  Not going to worry about it now as it's under 340k anyway, not enough bang for the buck
  - things accomplished
    - async interface added some time ago
    - npm package published long time ago
    - as of v 1.2.0 we only have verbs known to be used as per la RAE
    - use pre 1.2.0 version for verbs unknown to la RAE

- 4/27/2020 (0.5.0) - have all models implemented, what's next?
  - take a few days off
  - add async interface
  - clean up and publish to npm
  - there are 12815 known verbs, probably half of them are obsolete.  
    - want to keep all of them to be able to match a verb or its form to old texts, however ...
  - things I'd like to have
    - build a trie to be able to search for any form of any verb
    - have a separate *use only known (per la RAE) verbs* interface option?
    - shrink the size
    - will keep adding options here
