# conjugate-esp

Spanish verb conjugator, use pattern matching & logic to conjugate Spanish verbs
Nothing much here yet, version 0.1.1 - very basic

## Idea

TypeScript/JavaScript npm module that **doesn't** use lookup tables to do the work, small, fast.  Preferrably correct ...

## Status 3/18/2020

Conjugation of regular -ar, -er, -ir verbs in castellano, voseo, formal, canarias regions.
Includes mechanisms for dealing with defectives and multiple conjugations.
